Testing the Submission Microservice

I’ve set up a microservice to store submission data, and I need to test it to make sure everything’s working correctly. Here’s how I can do that:

Update the Test File
First, I need to update the test_submission_service.py file. I’ll replace its content with the following code:

python
import unittest
import requests

class TestSubmissionService(unittest.TestCase):
    BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000'  # I'll adjust this if my backend runs on a different port or URL

    def test_submit_submission(self):
        payload = {
            "title": "Software Engineer",
            "specialty": "Backend Development",
            "city": "San Francisco",
            "state": "CA",
            "salary": 120000,
            "years_of_experience": 5
        }
        response = requests.post(f'{self.BASE_URL}/submission', json=payload)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json().get('status'), 'Submission successful')

    def test_get_submissions(self):
        response = requests.get(f'{self.BASE_URL}/submissions')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        submissions = response.json()
        self.assertIsInstance(submissions, list)
        if submissions:
            self.assertIn('title', submissions[0])
            self.assertIn('specialty', submissions[0])
            self.assertIn('city', submissions[0])
            self.assertIn('state', submissions[0])
            self.assertIn('salary', submissions[0])
            self.assertIn('years_of_experience', submissions[0])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Running the Tests
Ensure the Backend is Running: Before running the tests, I need to make sure the microservice is up and running. If it’s not, I’ll start it with:

bash
Copy code
python review_service.py
Run the Test Script: Next, I’ll run the test script with:

bash
Copy code
python test_submission_service.py
Checking the Results
For test_submit_submission:

I’ll send a POST request to /submission with some test data.
I’ll check if the response status code is 200 and if the response message says 'Submission successful'.
For test_get_submissions:

I’ll send a GET request to /submissions.
I’ll make sure the response status code is 200 and that the response is a list that includes the expected fields.
}
Response:
{
  "status": "Review submitted"
}
GET /reviews
Retrieves the list of restaurant reviews.

Response:
[
  {
    "restaurant": "Restaurant Name",
    "review": "Review message",
    "rating": 5
  },
  {
    "restaurant": "Another Restaurant",
    "review": "Another review message",
    "rating": 4
  }
]
Testing
You can utilize the test_review_service.py file as a reference for testing.
